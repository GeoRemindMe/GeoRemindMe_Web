H2O template markup
========================
Being a martial art fan, I burrow a quote.

>Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. **Be water my friend**. -- Bruce Lee


H2o template
------------------------
H2O is markup language for PHP that taken a lot of inspiration from django.

 * Readable and human friendly syntax.
 * Easy to use and maintain
 * Encourage reuse in templates by template inclusion and inheritance.
 * highly extensible through filters, tags and template extensions.
 * Bundled rich set of filters and tags for string formatting, HTML helpers and 
   internationalization.

Getting started
------------------------

### Getting h2o

Download

[<img src="http://github.com/images/modules/download/zip.png">](http://code.google.com/p/h2o-template/downloads)
 
With Git

`git clone http://github.com/speedmax/h2o-php.git`

With SVN 

`svn checkout http://h2o-template.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ h2o`

### Installation
 1. Download and extract h2o in your project path or your php include path

    Sample file structure setup 
     
        myawesome_app/
            index.php
            templates/
              index.html
            h2o/


 2. use `require 'h2o/h2o.php'` in your php statement to include h2o library
 3. Below is a quick start code example to get a kick start 
 3. checkout example and specs if you are in the mood for exploration. 
 
*templates/index.html*

    <body>
        <head><title>Hello world</title></head>
        <body>
            Greetings {{ name }}
        </body>
    </body>

*index.php*

    <?php
        require 'h2o/h2o.php';
        $h2o = new h2o('templates/index.html');
        echo $h2o->render(array('name'=>'Peter Jackson'));
    ?>

Syntax explanation
------------------------

## variable
`{{ variable }}`

Use dot (.) to access attribute of a variable

#### variable lookup order
1. key of associative array
2. array-index 
3. object attribute
4. object method call

**Example**

*in your template*

    {{ person.name }} 

*in php*

    <?php 
        $h2o = new H2o('template.tpl');
        $person =array(
                'name' => 'Peter Jackson', 'age' => 25
        );
        $h2o->render(compact('person'));
    ?>
    
Let's say you have assigned a person variable in your php script, following 
variable tag will print out `Peter Jackson`

## Filters

Filters are variable modifiers to manipulate or format the value of a variable. 
A filter usually look like this `{{ person.name|capitalize }}`, a pipe ( | ) 
character after a variable will apply a filter.

__Filter chaining__

![filter chaining](http://wiki.shopify.com/upload/8/8c/Filterchain.jpg)  
Let me burrow the image from liquid template

You can chain multiple filters together and use a pipe ( | ) character to separate 
them. `{{ document.body|escape|nl2br }}`

__Filter arguments__  
Filters can accept arguments for example `{{ document.description|truncate 20 }}` 
will display first 20 character of
document description. Moreover, there are cases you want to pass multiple arguments 
and you can use comma( , ) to separate them
`{{ person.bio|truncate 20, "..." }}`

__Filter named arguments__  
h2o uses colon ( : ) to for named arguments to build optional arguments array. 

`{{ '/images/logo.png' | image_tag width:450, height:250, alt:"company logo" }}`

and this translate to php will be this and that is pretty much what happen internally
    
    <?php
        echo image_tag("/image/logo.png", array(
            'width' => 450, 
            'height' => 250, 
            'alt'=>'company logo'
        ));
    ?>

Note: Difference with Django, Smarty 
H2o do not use colon ( : ) character to separate arguments for readability reasons, 
h2o uses comma ( , ) which is more logical.

 
## Tag  

`{% tag %}`

Tags are usually very powerful, they controls the logical flow or structure, 
iteration. there are inline tags `{% inline_tag %}` or tags that requires a 
close tag. for example: `{% if condition %} ... {% endif %}` 


### if tag

if tag evaluate a variable or a simple expression. when results true the if tag 
body will be render or else part will be rendered.
    
    {% if person.is_adult %}
        You are old enough.
    {% else %}
        sorry, you are too young for that.
    {% endif %}

### for tag

For tag will iterate over a array of items. 
 
    {% for task in tasks %}
        {{ task }}
    {% endfor %}

Above will print all the tasks.

Template inheritance
------------------------
H2o supports template inheritance, it is very powerful and the concept is easy 
to understand. 

Template inheritance is implemented using block, extends tag, for programmers 
who is familiar with object oriented principles this is easy. 

Quote from Django doc
> ... a base skeleton template that contains all the common elements of your 
> site and defines blocks that child templates can override.


*Example:*

_base.html_ - to define the base structure of the page.

    <html>
     <head><title>{%block title %}This is a page title {% endblock %}</title></head>
     <body>
     <div id="content">
       {% block content%}
           <h1> Page title </h1>
           <p> H2O template inheritance is a powerful tool </p> 
       {% endblock %}
     </div>
    
     <div id="sidebar">
       {% block sidebar %}{% endblock %}
     </div>
     </body>
    </html>

As you can see, the base template is a typical web page using a two column layout, 
we defined two blocks (content, sidebar) and HTML code common across all your page.


_page.html_ - to define a template specific of a page.

    {% extends 'base.html' %}
    
    {% block content %}
        <h1> extended page </h1>
        <p> Body of extended page</p>
    {% endblock %}
    
    {% block sidebar %}
        Sidebar contains use links.
    {% endblock %}


The page.html extends base.html, now you will be able to override any block 
previously defined. 

There is a very good article about template inheritance in Django, in area of 
template inheritance h2o work exactly the same way.

[Power of inheritance][3] is a very good blog post explaining inheritance 

 [3]:http://www2.jeffcroft.com/blog/2006/feb/25/django-templates-the-power-of-inheritance/

*Tips*

* if you found you have a lot of common element inside the template, it may be a 
  good idea to put that portion of template in side a block in a base template. 
* block gives you a hook, especially useful they are useful for javascript, css
  too
* When defining a block use a short and distinctive name



### Configuration
There are a range of option to set up the template system the way you want it.

    <?php
        $h2o = new H2o('template.tpl', array(
            [option_name] => [option_value]
        ));
    ?>

#### loader
name of loader or a instance of H2o_Loader

__Use file loader [default]__

` $template = new H2o('index.html', array('loader'=>'file'); `


__Advance setup__
    <?php
    $loader = new H2o_File_Loader($custom_searchpath);
    $template = new H2o('index.html', array('loader'=> $loader );
    ?>
    
__Use dictionary loader__

You may want to load template from other resource than file then this will be your
friend. h2o use `dict_loader()` for testing.

    <?php
        $loader = dict_loader(array(
            "index.html" => 'Hello {{ person }}'
        ));
        $template = new H2o('index.html', array('loader' => $loader'));
    ?> 

#### searchpath

default: this will be the base path of your template

h2o use this path to load additional templates and extensions. 

You can either explicity set the search path

`$template = new H2o('index.html', array('searchpath' => '/sites/common_templates'));`

or It will try to find the searchpath for you

`$template = new H2o('/sites/common_templates/index.html');`

#### cache
define type of caching engine h2o needs to use, set to false to disable 
caching, you can read more about performance and caching in following sections

use file cache [default]

`$template = new H2o('index.html', array('cache'=>'file'));`

use apc cache

`$template = new H2o('index.html', array('cache'=>'apc'));`

memcache module not implemented yet

disable caching

`$template = new H2o('index.html', array('cache'=>false));`

#### cache_dir
When file cache is used, you can define where you want templates to be cached. 

it will put cached template in same location as that template

`$template = new H2o('index.html', array('cache_dir'=>'/tmp/cached_templates'));`

#### cache_ttl
how long template cache will be lived (defaults: 1 hour), template fregment cache that is bundled
in cache extension will use this as default ttl value.

`$template = new H2o('index.html', array('cache_ttl' => 3600));`


Performance and Caching
------------------------

Caching can increase performance since it skips step of inefficient template parsing, 
H2o caches the template objects(internal data structure of a template) and bundled
multiple caching backend includes File, APC and memcache.

### File cache
By default h2o uses file cache to store template objects, change h2o option `cache_dir` to where you 
want to store template cache (ie: /tmp).
  
    <?php
        $template = new H2o('homepage.tpl', array(
            'cache' => 'file',
            'cache_dir' => '/tmp'
        ));
    ?>

### APC cache
APC is a opt-code cache php extension that also provides a robust object cache, 
and the performance is generally 10-30% faster than file caching. 

    <?php
        $template = new h2o('homepage.tpl', array('cache' => 'apc'));
    ?>

### Memcache
currently not implemented


Extending H2o
------------------------


Known issues
------------------------
Realistically these are very very rare cases, so don't let it stop you getting your
foot wet. 

 * `{{ block.super }}` doesn't work with very deep inheritance so if `{{ block.super }}`
   invokes another `{{ block.super }}` it won't work just yet.  
 * If conditions doesn't support multiple expression or math yet, 
   `{% if something > 3 or something < 2 %}` or `{% if something + else > 12 %}`
    and i don't think
   i plan to implement them that kind of force you to construct a better data
   api any way.

There are concepts or ideas burrowed from following projects, Very early version of
h2o was based on the code base of Ptemplates so thanks to Armin Ronacher.
